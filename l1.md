## Set Theory

A set is a collection of objects of the same nature

Examples:
- $A = \{0, 1, 5\}$
- $\emptyset = \{\}$ 
- $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}$
- $\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}$

Notation: $x \in A$ means "x is an element of A"

Ex:
- $3 \in \mathbb{N}$
- $-4 \notin \mathbb{N}$
- $x \notin \emptyset$ (no matter what x is)

> All set above were defined by <u>extension</u>, which means, by listing their
> individual elements. But this is not always a good method...

Ex: 
$\mathbb{Q} = \{0, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{-42}{11}, ...\}$ 
*What's the pattern?*

We can also define sets by <u> comprehension </u>, i.e. by restricting a larger set
to its elements with a certain property:
$${S = \{x \in A | p(x)\}}$$

ex:
- even numbers: $E = \{ n \in \mathbb{Z} \space | \space n = 2k  \space for \space some \space k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$
- odd numbers: $O = \{ n \in \mathbb{Z} \space | \space n = 2k + 1 \space for \space some \space k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$
- rational numbers: $\mathbb{Q} = \{ \frac{a}{b} \space | \space a \in \mathbb{Z},  \space b \in \mathbb{N} \space and \space GCD(a,b) = 1\}$

## Subsets: if every element of A is also an element of B, we say that A is a <u>subset</u> of B, and we write $A \subseteq B$
ex:
$\{1, 2, 3\} \in \mathbb{N} \in \mathbb{Z}$
> We say that $\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$, since each $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ corresponds to the rational number $\frac{n}{1}$
> $\emptyset \subseteq X$ for any set $X$

## Equality: 2 sets A and B are equal (written A = B) if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$
ex: $\{1,2,3\} = \{3,1,2\}$

## Cardinality:
