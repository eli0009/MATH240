# Set Theory

A set is a collection of objects of the same nature

Examples:
- $A = \{0, 1, 5\}$
- $\emptyset = \{\}$ 
- $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}$
- $\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}$

Notation: $x \in A$ means "x is an element of A"
Ex:
- $3 \in \mathbb{N}$
- $-4 \notin \mathbb{N}$
- $x \notin \emptyset$ (no matter what x is)

> All set above were defined by <u>extension</u>, which means, by listing their
> individual elements. But this is not always a good method...

Ex: 
$\mathbb{Q} = \{0, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{-42}{11}, ...\}$ *What's the pattern?*

We can also define sets by <u> comprehension </u>, i.e. by restricting a larger set
to its elements with a certain property
Notation: ${S = \{x \in A | p(x)\}}$
ex:
- even numbers: $E = \{ n \in \mathbb{Z} | n = 2k ~for~some~k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$
